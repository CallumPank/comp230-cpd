# Weekly Reports

## Week One 
This week we looked at what we are going to do for the rest of the semester and had our first lecture with Brian where we talked about OpenGL and how we can apply it to our work. OpenGL looks difficult but I’m sure I can pick it up. 

For our second lecture we had AL and we looked at different research techniques for writing and making questionnaires, we also talked about what type of work we will doing over the semester the AR/VR game sounds particularly fun. 

For our third lecture we had Michael where we looked at the ethics within game development which I found quite interesting.
 The rest of the week I met with my team and we discussed what type of game we wanted to make, and we decided that myself and Jonny should make a demo on unreal and Kyle (The other programmer on the team) would make a demo in unity. The purpose of this was to decide which game engine would be best suited to make a potential game in.

## Week Two 
Continuing with looking at OpenGL we looked at adding shaders and geometry to the work we did last week, I am finding this work particularly confusing as it is a lot of information at once which I do not deal with well. It is not too bad now though. 

We continued looking at different techniques for evaluations of games, this week we looked at heuristic evaluations and useful they are. I found this type of research quite interesting as it pulled a lot of information from the person playing the game which made the demo games we were testing seem like they were full of flaws. We must make a questionnaire for the game we made last week which I think will be good as the game we made last year was not that great and full of things that could be improved but could really show what we needed to improve on.

This week we looked at different computing disasters that had occurred, the most interesting was where a space shuttle had blown up because a program had been copied over to the back up, but both had a flaw, so the shuttle blew up. We then had a dialogue about the computing disasters which not really many people spoke in.

The rest of the week we looked at the demos we had created and decided that we would use unity as myself and Jonny wanted to use a different language and for the games we had in mind Unity seemed like an excellent choice. Martin (Our Product Owner) said that we should make three demos over the week and decide which one we liked best.

## Week Three
This week we looked at the maths that we could apply to OpenGL which I did not find too hard when Brian was explaining it but applying it to the work was a lot harder than I thought it would be, I think that I should go and look up easier ways to apply these techniques or at least try and figure out how this works.

This week we looked at how research would be carried out for our questionnaires on our old games and what type of questions (Qualitative and Quantitative) were best suited for our questionnaire. We then had to document our finding on GitHub pages which utilised HTML and CSS which do not seem that hard.

For the rest of the week I worked with my team and we had decided which prototype we wanted to go with a top down horror game, which we think is simple and not over scoped, I have been slacking implementing things into this game so I’m hoping to put more in this week.

## Week Four
This week we looked at adding more into our OpenGL projects specifically Vertex data and Element buffers, we looked at drawing a square and a cube. I am starting to find this quite difficult and I am going to ask Brian to help me as this is starting to get ridiculous now.

This week we looked at analysing data and reporting the data onto GitHub pages which will basically put graphs onto GitHub pages. Which I did not find too bad as HTML is not as bad I thought it was.

The rest of the week we looked at I worked on the group game and started to draft ideas to put into the game and how we could improve the game I mostly worked with designers this week and did not really do much implementation.

## Week Five 
This week we looked at rendering complex 3D meshes and applying textures to them. This was quite interesting, but I still found it hard to do, I really need to work on catching up on this work. 

This week we had peer reviews for out questionnaire research I did not have enough research to get it looked at, so I reviewed three other peoples. But I did get a lot of info on how to improve my work.

We then pitched our collaborative game project this happened to be our top down horror game idea, which we think went well.

## Week Six
This week was studio practise week I just looked at catching up on work and implementing things into my game project.

## Week Seven
This week we looked at materials and lighting specifically the Blinn-Phong illumination model which was interesting. I am still behind on my work, but I do not have a lot of time to work on this with ALs work coming up.

We looked at how players get immersed in AR/VR games and the strength and weaknesses of different VR/AR systems. We then looked at what our second assignment would be, this would be a VR/AR game that we want to create. I am going to try and do my work on a Microsoft HoloLens as I find that incredibly fun to use.
This week we had presentations on what our ideas would be for our essays, mine was received quite well and I received very useful feedback on what I should be doing to get a better grade.

The rest of the week I worked with the team and we realised that none of us were motivated to work on the game, so we decided to scrap it and make a game that was much more fun than the other one. We realised that it is very hard to make a good horror game and that the game took itself too seriously. Whereas we wanted to create a fun game.

## Week Eight 
This week we looked at Rigging and Animating for our OpenGL project which I found incredibly long and frustrating to do, I feel like I am not retaining any of the information for this assignment.

This week we looked at the psychology in relation to human-centred design for AR/VR and the practical aspects of making a VR/AR system. This lecture was fun and is my favourite module on the course now.

This week we had a peer review of our essays for ethics and professionalism I did not have a lot written down but the feedback I received was very helpful in shaping how the rest of the essay was going to be.
The rest of the week I worked on our new team game which is a couch arena shooter on ice.

## Week Nine 
This week we looked at post processing such as things like blur, night vision etc. This was interesting but still confusing.
This week we continued to work on our VR/AR games. I have been having problems trying to get the HoloLens to work with the computers in the studio which has been hindering my work a lot. 

This week we looked at working on our CPD work and getting up to date on it.
The rest of the week I looked at implanting some things into the game some of the things that I made before were taken out because they did not fit with the direction the game was going.

## Week Ten
This week we looked at Reactivision which used paper counters with symbols on them to detect with a webcam where they were and what they could do. Which was interesting but not useful for what I was planning on designing.
The rest of the week I worked on the game and trying to finish off some outstanding projects.

## Week Eleven
This week I worked on completing outstanding projects and working on the group game project.

## Week Twelve 

This is the final week of the semester and I am going to be working on finishing my assignments and hopefully getting help with the OpenGL project.
