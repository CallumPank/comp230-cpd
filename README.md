# Weekly Reports

## Week One

First week back had a tour around the games academy, looked nice and frankly a lot better than the old studio. The first lecture I had was with Brian and this was looking at SQL and OpenGl whihc looks incredibly confusing but that should hopefully change.

Second lecture had Al and this was looking at websites and evalutions for games. Not too confident on my HTML but we shall where it goes.

The next lecture with Michael was looking at our ethicval views on topics within the games industry. I prefer essays at the moment to coding but I think that is becuase I am still not into the coding flow fully yet.

## Week Two

This week we looked at programming triangles, this project had a lot of code to it which looked daunting and I was very confused by what it all meant.

For Als assignment we looked at the hololens and this is something I really like and could see myself having fun developing with may start taking it out and using it if possible.

For COMP 230 we looked at disasters that have occurred becuase of errors in programming which was interesting to research. We then had a dialogue about dialogues which meant we discussed what we thought a dialogue was between everyone I did not have anything worthwhile to contribute.

The group project has started finally and at this point we are prototyping but we are not sure what engine we are going to use so the BA programmer and the BSC programmers have split up and are working in the engines we use best so we will see how that goes.

## Week Three

This week we looked at adding colour to our triangles using fragment and vertices shaders. I managed to turn the colour of mnine but I still find this OpenGL stuff very confusing.

We looked at questionaires for COMP 210, the sample size Al wants may be slightly hard to get and balancing out genders and different disciplines will be rather difficult.

This week we had more dialogues I did not take part part very much again.

For the group project we had made a few prototypes but none of them really substantial or interesting enough to take forward, we started looking at making a prototype every four days as a way to maximise our ideas. We still have not decided the engine we are going to use but I have no aversion to using Unity I prefer scripting to blueprints anyway.

I have also been taking out the Hololens which has been really fun, I tried making a basic hologram but my computer at home can't install the SDKs for some reason.

## Week Four

We looked at turning a square into a cube in COMP 220 which is making the code even more difficult to understand.

For COMP 220 we looked at a worksheet about data and how we could visually represent this data.

Had the group pitch for the game which was interesting I feel that we were not prepared for it as well as we could have been.
